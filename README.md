# Covid-19-site
A university project for a sample site showing the COVID-19 cases depending on what the user asks with a form.
As part of our work, we had to implement an application with which: We stored local (on disk) data about the coronavirus pandemic. The data had to be stored, processed and, through a web page that we designed and implement, can be queried using Apache-MySQL-PHP (or Python, etc.).
